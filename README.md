## Overview

### Screenshot

![QR Code Challenge Preview Image](./preview.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<figure
                class="card"
                aria-labelledby="card-heading"
                aria-describedby="card-description"
            >
                <div class="card__image-wrapper">
                    <img
